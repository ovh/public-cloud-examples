# Accessing an instance from a regional private network to another via vRack

This example builds 3 separated private routed networks on 3 regions.

An additionnal network is build for communication between regions.

2 instances are build onto 2 distinct regions, the `bastion` one to access the private networks, and the `target` one that is simply builded to be accessed.

The access to the `bastion` instance is permitted by `Floating IP` implementation.
