        VERIFICATION CHALLENGE: Someone told me these details about their car, but I want you to check if the photos actually match what they claimed.

        THEIR CLAIMS:
        - Make/Manufacturer: {user_claims.get('manufacturer', 'Not specified')}
        - Model: {user_claims.get('model', 'Not specified')}
        - Color: {user_claims.get('color', 'Not specified')}
        - Damage Status: {user_claims.get('damage', 'Not specified')}

        YOUR JOB: Look at these photos and tell me:

        1. MANUFACTURER VERIFICATION:
           - What make/brand do you actually see in the photos?
           - Does this match their claim of "{user_claims.get('manufacturer', 'unknown')}"?
           - How confident are you?

        2. MODEL VERIFICATION:
           - What model do you think this actually is?
           - Does this match their claim of "{user_claims.get('model', 'unknown')}"?
           - Could you be wrong about the model?

        3. COLOR VERIFICATION:
           - What color is this car in the photos?
           - Does this match their claim of "{user_claims.get('color', 'unknown')}"?
           - Any color variations or damage affecting color?

        4. DAMAGE VERIFICATION:
           - What damage do you actually see (if any)?
           - They claimed: "{user_claims.get('damage', 'unknown')}"
           - Does what you see match what they said?

        5. OVERALL VERDICT:
           - Do the photos generally match their claims?
           - What discrepancies did you find?
           - Anything suspicious or inconsistent?

        Be honest about what you can and can't tell from these photos!
