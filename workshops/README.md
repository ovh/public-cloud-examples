## [101-AI-and-py](./101-AI-and-py/)

The aim of this workshop is to build from scratch an application to plays "paper / rock / scissors".  
First, the YOLO model is customized to detect the "paper / rock / scissors".
Then you can train with more data.
And at the end an application is developed to use the trained model.  
See the steps in the [documentation](./101-AI-and-py/README.md) for more details.

Note that a [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/) workspace is pre-configured to facilitate the workshop progress.
