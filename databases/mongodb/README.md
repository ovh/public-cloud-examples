# Managed MongoDb database with private network

This example builds a Managed MongoDb database connected to a private network within OVHcloud Public Cloud.

The components that will be created are :

- A [Managed MongoDb database](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en/public-cloud/mongodb)

![Managed MongoDb](./img/img01.png)

## Pre-requisites

You need to follow steps from the [basics tutorial](../../basics/README.md) for having necessary tools and a fonctionnal `ovhrc` file.

You need to have a functional routed private network. If not read and apply the [Simple private network](../../networking/private-network-mono-region/README.md) tutorial.

## properties files

This is the parameters needed by the scripts:

![Managed MongoDb](./img/img02.png)

Edit the `variables.auto.tfvars` file to modify values:

```terraform
// Region

region = "GRA7"

// Region for database

db_region = "GRA"

// Network - Private Network

pv_network_name = "my_private_network"

// Network - Subnet

subnet_name = "my_subnet"

// Database

db_description = "myMongoDb"
db_engine = "mongodb"
db_version = "6.0"
db_plan = "business"
db_flavor = "db1-7"

// Database User

db_user_name = "myuser"
db_user_role = ["readWriteAnyDatabase"]

// IP Restriction

db_allowed_ip = "192.168.2.0/24"
```

> Note: db_user_role possible values are:
>
>    "readAnyDatabase"
>    "readWriteAnyDatabase"
>    "userAdminAnyDatabase"
>    "dbAdminAnyDatabase"
>    "backup"
>    "restore"

## Create

Create the MongoDb database with this commands:

```bash
source ovhrc
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

Or simply use the `createDb.sh` script.

```bash
./createDb.sh
```

Partner and community providers are signed by their developers.
If you'd like to know more about provider signing, you can read about it here:
https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/plugins/signing.html

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

## Get current user password

```bash

## Reset current user password

Open and edit the `resources.tf` file and change the value of the `password_reset` parameter, from the `ovh_cloud_project_database_mongodb_user` resource block.

Then, re-apply the plan to perform a password reset and get the new one with:

```bash
terraform apply
terraform output db_user_password
